            "message": "Declarative Rollup Lookup Summaries (DLRS) is a sustainable open source community application that provides an admin-friendly declarative interface to generate and manage cross-object rollup summaries in your Salesforce org.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\n- Rollup information between Lookup relationships, not previously possible without writing Apex Triggers.\r\n- Define rollups using standard declarative UI, no coding required.\r\n- Define filter criteria on rollups, like rolling up Closed Won Opportunity Amount onto Account.\r\n- Run rollups in Realtime, Scheduled and Developer API modes.\r\n\r\nResources:\r\n\r\n- [Documentation](https://sfdo-community-sprints.github.io/DLRS-Documentation/)\r\n- [Release notes](https://sfdo-community-sprints.github.io/DLRS-Documentation/Changelog/)\r\n- [Open source GitHub repository](https://github.com/SFDO-Community/declarative-lookup-rollup-summaries)\r\n- Learn more and get support: [Trailblazer Community Group](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/trailblazer-community/groups/0F9300000009O5pCAE?tab=discussion). Maintainers of this application and Salesforce.org Open Source Program team members actively monitor every post.\r\n\r\nNOTE: If you are currently upgrading from a version of DLRS that starts with the number 1 (e.g. 1.3), there are some additional post-installation steps that need to be done. For example, Lookup Rollup Summaries need to be moved from a Custom Object to the new Custom Metadata structure. See [this page](https://andyinthecloud.com/2015/12/24/declarative-lookup-rollup-summary-tool-and-custom-metadata/) for more details. \r\n\r\n\r\nMoving to Custom Metadata will give your organization access to the newest DLRS features and experience smoother upgrades to future versions. You can check which version of DLRS you have installed by going to \"Setup > Installed Packages.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAs always, make sure to test installations in a Sandbox before installing in Production.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SFDO-Community/declarative-lookup-rollup-summaries/main/images/DLRS%20OSC%20Badge.png\">",
